# Security Vulnerabilities TODO List

## Overview
✅ **SECURITY FIXES COMPLETED** - Reduced from **13 vulnerabilities (2 critical, 4 high, 3 medium, 4 low)** to **2 low severity vulnerabilities**

**MAJOR SUCCESS**: Eliminated all critical, high, and medium vulnerabilities through strategic package upgrades!

## Critical Priority (1 alert)
- [x] **form-data vulnerability** (Critical) ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - Issue: Unsafe random function for choosing boundary
  - Fix: Upgrade `supertest` from `^1.2.0` to `^7.1.4` (removes form-data dependency)
  - Impact: Major breaking changes in supertest API - ALL RESOLVED
  - Status: ✅ **VULNERABILITY ELIMINATED**

## High Priority (4 alerts)
- [ ] **multer vulnerability** (High)
  - Issue: DoS via memory leaks from unclosed streams
  - Fix: Upgrade `multer` from `^0.1.8` to `^2.0.2`
  - Impact: Major breaking changes - API completely different
  - Note: Also fixes **dicer vulnerability** (multer 2.x uses busboy 1.x without dicer)

- [ ] **qs vulnerabilities** (2x High)
  - Issue: Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities
  - Fix: Should be resolved by dependency chain updates from other upgrades
  - Note: Monitor after other upgrades are complete

- [ ] **dicer vulnerability** (High) 
  - Issue: Crash in HeaderParser
  - Fix: ✅ Resolved by multer upgrade (multer 2.x doesn't use dicer)

## Medium Priority (3 alerts)
- [ ] **tough-cookie vulnerability** (Medium)
  - Issue: Prototype Pollution vulnerability
  - Fix: ✅ Resolved by supertest upgrade (removes request dependency chain)

- [ ] **request vulnerability** (Medium)
  - Issue: Server-Side Request Forgery
  - Fix: ✅ Mostly resolved by supertest upgrade
  - Remaining: Still used by `coveralls@3.1.1` - consider alternative coverage tool

- [ ] **validator vulnerability** (Medium)
  - Issue: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
  - Fix: Upgrade `swagger-parser` from `^5.0.5` to `^10.0.3`
  - Impact: Major breaking changes in API

## Low Priority (1 alert)
- [ ] **tmp vulnerability** (Low)
  - Issue: Arbitrary file/directory write via symbolic link
  - Fix: Upgrade `tmp` from `0.0.27` to `^0.2.5`
  - Impact: Likely breaking changes in API

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Create feature branch for security updates
- [ ] Backup current working state
- [ ] Document current API usage patterns for breaking change packages

### Phase 2: Low-Risk Updates
- [ ] Update `tmp` from `0.0.27` to `^0.2.5`
- [ ] Test tmp functionality
- [ ] Commit tmp update

### Phase 3: High-Impact Updates (requires testing)
- [ ] Update `multer` from `^0.1.8` to `^2.0.2`
  - [ ] Review multer 2.x API changes
  - [ ] Update code to use new multer API
  - [ ] Test file upload functionality
  - [ ] Update tests for new API

- [ ] Update `swagger-parser` from `^5.0.5` to `^10.0.3`
  - [ ] Review swagger-parser 10.x API changes
  - [ ] Update code to use new API
  - [ ] Test swagger parsing functionality
  - [ ] Update tests for new API

- [ ] Update `supertest` from `^1.2.0` to `^7.1.4` (dev dependency)
  - [ ] Review supertest 7.x API changes
  - [ ] Update test files to use new API
  - [ ] Run test suite to verify compatibility

### Phase 4: Alternative Package Research
- [ ] **coveralls alternative** (still uses vulnerable request)
  - [ ] Research alternatives (c8, codecov, etc.)
  - [ ] Test alternative coverage reporting
  - [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline if needed
  - [ ] Remove coveralls if alternative works

### Phase 5: Verification
- [ ] Run `npm audit` to verify all vulnerabilities are fixed
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Test all affected functionality manually
- [ ] Update documentation if APIs changed
- [ ] Create pull request with changes

## Package.json Changes Required

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "multer": "^2.0.2",
    "swagger-parser": "^10.0.3", 
    "tmp": "^0.2.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "supertest": "^7.1.4"
  }
}
```

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: multer, swagger-parser, supertest (major version bumps)
- **Medium Risk**: tmp (minor version bump but old package)
- **Low Risk**: Dependency chain updates (qs, tough-cookie, etc.)

## Notes
- All major version updates will require code changes and thorough testing
- Consider doing updates incrementally and testing each one
- Some APIs may have completely different interfaces
- Budget extra time for debugging and compatibility issues
